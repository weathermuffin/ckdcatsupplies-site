# First Time

Welcome! Although, if you're here, it means your cat has CKD, and
I'm sorry for that.

By now you've undoubtedly experienced what a challenging roller
coaster feline CKD is. [Luna]({% link docs/about.md %}) was
diagnosed in February 2024, and I empathize and relate to your
situation.

Based on my experience with Luna, here are...

## The Three Best Things You Can Do Right Now for Your CKD Kitty and You

1. Sign up to join
[Tanya's Feline Chronic Kidney Disease Support Group](https://tanyackd.groups.io/g/support).
Even if you don't post your story and questions right away, you'll
learn a ton by reading the messages that come in. This group is
filled with many experienced and compassionate experts who can
help you with guidance and support. Perhaps I'll see you there.

2. Visit [What You Need to Know First](https://felinecrf.org/just_diagnosed.htm)
on Tanya's Comprehensive Guide to Feline Chronic Kidney Disease.
Also, block out some time each day over the next week or two to
read as much of this site as you can. It's an unbelievably valuable
resource and the knowledge you gain now will pay dividends
throughout you and your kitty's CKD journey.

3. Start looking for an internal medicine specialist and get on
their calendar. It's apparent that many general practice vets
are underprepared to deal with a complex systemic medical issue
like CKD. They may be too up to their eyeballs pulling foxtails
out of dogs and other day-to-day requirements to give your cat's
CKD the time, attention, and painstaking research it deserves.
And, sadly, many vets suggest euthanasia way too early.
This disease is an intricate dance, and finding a competent
veterinary internal medicine specialist to work with now will
serve you well in the long run. Specialists have a tendency to
book up well in advance, so the sooner you can get on the
calendar, the better.

One more note about the felinecrf.org website mentioned above.
Once you've had a chance to read it, and realize what an incredible
resource it is, and have a moment to breathe... Please consider
dontating to Helen, the maintaner of that web site. Much love and
labor has gone into that site, which has helped thousands of CKD
kitties around the world.

(I have absolutely no relation to Helen or the felinecrf.org web
site; I just happen to be a CKD cat caregiver who has benefitted
immeasurably from Helen's work, and want to do what I can to help
keep the site going for the benefit of all cats.)


## How to Use This Site

This site is not a store or a shop. It's a collection of links
to products I've either used with Luna or have researched for
potentially using with Luna. When it's time to get something for
her, I return to this list to find it.

If you're reading through felinecrf.org or the support group,
and see mention of a supplement or product and have questions
like

- Which exact product are they referring to?

- Which one is safe for cats?

- Which one is best for CKD?

...then come to this vetted list of CKD cat supplies.

Go ahead and bookmark this site now so you can be sure and find it
again when you need it.

Each item that appears provides valuable information at your
fingertips, such as

- A link to the relevant page on Tanya's Comprehensive Guide

- An anecdote about how Chuck & Luna use it

- Links to research and other relevant resources

- Links to various vendors that carry the product

The items are organized into categories. Simply click on any
category to see all the pertinent items.

At the moment this site is geared primarily toward U.S. residents,
with links to U.S.-based sources. If you'd like to see sources
for your home location, please let me know in an email.

Best wishes on your CKD journey. If you have any questions or
concerns, please reach out. I'm here to help.
